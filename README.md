# Simple Blog Application - Frontend

This is a simple single-page web application for managing blog posts, built as a frontend-only project. It demonstrates key frontend development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and a modular code structure.

## Features

-   **View Blog Posts:** Displays a list of blog post titles on the side.
-   **View Post Details:** Clicking a title shows the full post content in a main section.
-   **Add New Posts:** Includes a form to create a new blog post.
-   **Update Posts:** Allows you to edit the title and content of an existing post.
-   **Delete Posts:** Provides functionality to remove a post.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** For the application's structure.
-   **CSS3:** For styling and a responsive layout.
-   **JavaScript:** For all interactive logic and DOM manipulation.

## Setup & Running the Project

Since this is a frontend-only application, you do not need a backend server running to view it.

1.  **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2.  **Navigate to the project folder** in your file explorer.
3.  **Open the `index.html` file** in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome).

That's it! The application should load and you can interact with the blog posts.

## Project Structure

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file.
-   `style.css`: Contains all the CSS for the application's design.
-   `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for fetching data, rendering content, and handling user interactions.

## How it Works

The JavaScript (`script.js`) code is responsible for creating and updating the HTML elements on the page. It manages the display of post lists and details based on user clicks and form submissions.
